In this project we implemented a spiking neural network in MATLAB with Izhikevich equations, and observed the modes (chattering, intrinsically bursting...) of the neurons, as well as their firing rate, depending on the parameters of the equations and the shape of the neural network.

For now I just put the raw code we implemented back then in 2013 (some parts directly come from Pr. Izhikevich webpage), but I plan to make the code more usable if I have time.
